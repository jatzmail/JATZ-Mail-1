# JATZ-Mail

## What it does
This is an email sending code where you can send emails from any email of your choice.

## Requirements
- It will have to be a Gmail account until further notice.
- You will have to edit the sender_email to the email you want to send.
- You will also have to edit the sender's email account to allow for less secure apps (Python)

## Disclaimer

If you do this your account may be vulernable so it's better if you make a new email just for this
